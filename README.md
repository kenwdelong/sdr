Files for getting SDR to work, mainly on RPi4

I really wanted to get this working with Ansible, but it never worked.  So then I did it all by hand, and it still didn't work.  The last run is documented in installation.txt. At the end, I always run into https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-sdr/issues/196.

Next suggestion: Is user weewx in the plugdev group?
