The pool sensor randomly changes it's house code every few days. 

This is the hack I added to /etc/weewx/bin/user/sdr.py around line 1150.  If it's channel 4 (the pool), force the house code to 137 (which is currently the number in weewx.conf).



        # === KENS MODIFICATIONS
        channel = obj.get('channel', 0)
        if channel == 4:
            house_code = 137
        else:
            house_code = obj.get('id', 0) # This line was here before, and uncoditional
        # === END MODIFICATIONS
